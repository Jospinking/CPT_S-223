# Homework #1 (HW1) - Big-O and Linux/Git questions

The homeworks in this course are genral knowledge and theory questions. They address topics around the code and concepts. You may do these homework assignments digitally or by printing them off and doing them by hand. Once done, either print them to PDF or scan them in to a PDF file. Put the file into this directory, add/commit/push it to your repo and then place a small file on Blackboard to let the TA know you've completed the assignment.

I will put a GitLab CI test on this homework, but it'll just be testing for the PDF file in this directory (the file is any that ends in .pdf). The CI tests won't actually grade the work, of course.
